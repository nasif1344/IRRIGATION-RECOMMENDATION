# IRRIGATION-RECOMMENDATION
🌱 Irrigation Recommendation System using Machine Learning

An intelligent machine learning system that predicts the irrigation need level (Low, Medium, High) for crops based on soil, weather, and crop parameters.
The project also includes an interactive Gradio web interface for real-time predictions.

🚀 Project Overview

Efficient irrigation is critical for improving crop yield and conserving water.
This project uses ML algorithms to analyze agricultural parameters and recommend the appropriate irrigation level.

The model takes inputs like:

Soil Type

Crop Type

Season

Temperature

Humidity

Rainfall

And predicts:

👉 Irrigation Need: Low / Medium / High

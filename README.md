# IRRIGATION-RECOMMENDATION
This project uses supervised machine learning to recommend irrigation levels based on agricultural and environmental features. Implemented using Python, Scikit-learn, and Random Forest, with visual insights and a Gradio-based interactive prediction interface.

Features

Predicts irrigation requirements based on input parameters
Uses Random Forest machine learning algorithm
Includes data preprocessing and visualization
Interactive Gradio web interface for real-time predictions
Easy to run in Jupyter Notebook
